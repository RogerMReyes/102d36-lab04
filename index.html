            <p>We are lucky to live in a glorious age that gives us everything we could ask for as a human race.</p>  
            <p>What more could you need when you have meat covered in cheese nestled between bread as a complete meal.</p>  
            <p>From smashed patties at Shake Shack to Glamburgers at Honky Tonk, thereâ€™s a little something for everyone.</p>              
            <p>Some burgers are humble, and some are ostentatious, and you just have to try them all to figure out what you want.    </p>
